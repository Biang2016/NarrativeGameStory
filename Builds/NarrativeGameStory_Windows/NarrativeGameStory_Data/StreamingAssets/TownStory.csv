"Dear Uncle, 

Today is cold and I'm ill. Thank you for the drum, I liked it very much. But Dalv broke it yesterday, he laughed at me because I want to be a musician, he is so mean. Oscar said he can help me fix it. 

Alan","Hey Issac, 

You won't believe this, pal: I bought a guitar! Right under my old man's nose! And he didn't even notice it! And it's amazing, nothing like the rubbish old one borrowed from the school. Now we're talking about starting a band, you in? 

Alan","Hey friend, 

Last night when I play my guitar in the metro station, a dude gave me 10 bucks and sat down, guess he just wanna buy my time. It was funny that he talked about his old man, the last word I wanna hear is 'dad'. His father left him for years and now since his mom dead he wanted the old bastard back. 

Alan","Dear Mr. Unkown

Can you help me please? I have a music dream but there are so many obstacles ahead. Can you clear them for me? I can do anything I could for you.

Mom has gone. Dad said mom moved to live with you, but I don't understand, because dad didn't drive mom to heaven, she just slept in a box underground. It looked so dark, won't mom scared?

I want to visit Emily next week. Emily is badly ill these days. She may be scared by Dalv. Dalv lent a lot of money to her and he want the money back now.

I am very surprised you are still alive. My wedding is next month. Do you plan to come?

Emily ","Friend,

It's glad to tell you that you are accepted by the vampire family. After that, we can drink blood and play happily together.

The Vampire Association","Jenna,

Honey, I think it's time to say goodbye. I am going to work in another state. Tell Emily pay attention to Lisa. She's not a good person.

Dalv","Jenna,

I think Biocreature Inc has some relationship with the rumor of vampires. That's horrible. If so, their medicine might transfer human into vampire!

Issac","Emily

I found you walking around Dalv's house. What did you find? I am asking just for curiosity.

Issac"
"Dalv,

Worried about Biocreature Inc. They're rumored to be doing human experiments. Is that right? I don't agree that you take such risks. At least you should meet Oscar first.

Lisa","Mom,

I am very worried about your illness. I'll go home tomorrow and I got an excuse from the band.

Issac",,"Dear Father, 

I am writing this letter to inform you that mom passed away yesterday. I don't want to hurt someone and to be hurt. But sometimes I cannot control myself. I love music but I would never touch it anymore.

Issac",,,"Dear Jenna,

This letter just for a test. If you cannot receive it, there must be someone inside the post office who monitors every letter about my father!

Issac","Dear Jenna,

I know you and Issac are very good friends. But once Issac start researching any about his father, please stop him. Thank you!

Lisa","Hey friend,

Please do our plan more earlier. Find some ways to kill him so that you'll be free. Hope to leave here with you.

Lisa","Oscar,

Can you help us offer Dalv a job in Biocreature Inc so that he can leave his wife and son. We can give you a fresh body.

Alan","Lisa,

I had a little accident. I cannot write to you as often as usual. No worries. Tell him I won't be there.

Dalv","Dear Issac,

Today I met Oscar. He is a doctor working in Biocreature Inc.. I think he might know something about your dad. 

Jenna","<Missing name>

Sorry I cannot write to you as often as usual. Someone has been noticing my letters and I should be careful. Help me in some way, please! You know it!

Issac","<Missing name>

I'm sorry to put you in such a dangerous situation. Take a rest. I will revenge myself on them all. But I didn't meet him today. Is there something wrong with our plan?

Issac","Lisa,

It's the time to get rid of Issac's interruption. His research will ruin us. Even his mother is one of us, we cannot wait to die! 

<Missing name>","Dalv,

I know you're working for the postoffice. Can you find some discarded letters for me?

Jenna",,,,,,"Hi Alan, 

I was thinking about drop the collage and go with you, but on a second thought, I'll stay. You've been a good friend since dad killed himself, you're MORE than a friend, for real. But I can't just...I want to be a doctor for the sake of mom. I believe we'll meet in the future.

I was scared last night. I found a dead body in front of Dalv' house. What's going on? Are you OK? Did he tell you about this?

Emily",,
"<Missing name>

I asked someone working in the postoffice and he said you live here. Listen, the doc said dad doesn't have much time left and he wants to see you. I know you two had rough time before but it's been a long time and we all tried to reach you during all these years, he regreted to kick you out. Whatever, if you saw this letter, we're at the Oakland City Hospital. 

Oscar","My boy, 

It's becoming cold these days, kid, you're so skinny and far away from home, I'm so worried. Your father is such a butt, I regret to brought him to this world. It broke my heart to know you left home and won't come back for Christmas. Put on this sweater I made for you, it is warm and a bit larger, I wish you could eat more. 

<A scrawled name>","Hey Oscar, 

Heard you're still writing to that little shit, well stop wasting your time. He will not answer you and it might be father's smartest decision to kick him outta our house. He didn't even showed up on grandma's funeral, grandma loved him the best, what kind of monster is he? Just leave him to die I'd say. 

Dalv","Emily,

I should go to see a patient in Oakland City Hospital. Don't tell anyone my plan especially Oscar.

You're only a worker of the company. Don't be interested in too many things. Take care of your family, otherwise they might be missing.

I hear from Oscar that the post office belongs to Biocreature Inc. They may monitor every letter from their staffs.

Jenna",,"Lisa,

I'm worried about her, Her husband beats her everytime he got drunk, but she'd never call the police. It's horrible. She asked me for help but I have no idea.

Emily","Hi Lisa, 

It's been months since you moved away, how's everything? I picked a scarf for you. Did you make a decision between Oscar and Dalv? Oscar is a good man, but Dalv, you know, he's kind of special.
